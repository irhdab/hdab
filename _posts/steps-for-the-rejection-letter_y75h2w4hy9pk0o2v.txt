Steps for the rejection letter
영어 거부 메일, 편지 쓰는 방법

1. Open with Appreciation
Start by acknowledging the request or expressing gratitude for the interest shown.
Example: "Your request for a refund has been received and appreciated."

2. State the Purpose of the Letter
Clearly state that the purpose of the letter is to address the request. This should be done in a soft, indirect way.
Example: "It is necessary to inform you that a refund will not be issued."

3. Provide the Reason for Refusal (Passively)
Explain the reason for the refusal in passive voice without focusing directly on the person.
Example: "A thorough review of the situation was conducted, and it was determined that the warranty does not cover accidental damage."

4. Offer Alternative Solutions or Suggestions
If possible, offer alternatives to soften the refusal, like repairs at a discount or further assistance.
Example: "Options for repair services can be explored at a reduced rate, if desired."

5. Close with Courtesy
End the letter on a polite note, expressing willingness to assist with any further inquiries or needs.
Example: "Your understanding is greatly appreciated, and any additional questions can be addressed by our support team."
